Hey Yall!

I pulled data from School and District Profiles for Massachusetts 
Public Schools. A comprehensive data set that includes data on on a number of
different metrics regarding Mass Public schools.

Im seeking to answer the following question: Does ethnicity make up
of a school district effect art courses offered, sat performance, disciplinary 
action, and teacher salaries?

Goals for the coming weeks!!!

1. Do group by for percent poc students to create a data set that I can make some bar graphs
with. Then make a bunch of comparable graphs using facetgrid.

2. bar graphs for each bin, with multiple average percent bars on one graph each of a different facet

3. one graph with bins on the x axis that shows average teacher salary for each bin on the same graph
