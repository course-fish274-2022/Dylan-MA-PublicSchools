## Concept

Im seeking to answer the following question: Does ethnicity make up
of a school district effect art courses offered, sat performance, disciplinary 
action, and teacher salaries?

In this document I will:

1. Load data from the [Portal Project Teaching Database](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459)
2. Process it into population time series
3. And make initial visualizations

## Required Packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
install.packages("Markdown")


## Data

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172")
head(data)
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172")
head(data)
```
